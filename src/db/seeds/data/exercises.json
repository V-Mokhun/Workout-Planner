    "overview": "",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSet up for the dumbbell stiff leg deadlift by choosing a pair of dumbbells and holding them down at your sides.</li>\n<li>\nStand up straight with a slight bend in your knees and your feet around shoulder width apart. This is your starting position.</li>\n<li>\nKeep your back as straight as possible and bend over at the waist lowering the dumbbells over the tops of you feet. Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably.</li>\n<li>\nNow engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up. Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for desired reps.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nExercise Tips:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nYou must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round!</li>\n<li>\nThe dumbbells need&#160;to stay&#160;close to your body throughout the set. The further the dumbbells are&#160;from your body the more strain is on your lower back.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the dumbbells and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise.</li>\n<li>\nIt's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set).</li>\n<li>\nDuring the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.</li>\n<li>\nDo not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back and abdominals tight as you begin the ascent.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!</li>\n<li>\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips with naturally move back.</li>\n<li>\nTechnique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "overview": "<p>The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every <a href=\"/workout-routines\">workout plan</a>.</p>\n<p>For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core.</p>\n<p>The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree.</p>\n<p>Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of the squat variations include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/bodyweight-squat.html\">Bodyweight Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/dumbbell-goblet-squat\">Goblet Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/landmine-goblet-squat\">Landmine Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/front-squat.html\">Front Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/dumbbell-squat.html\">Dumbbell Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/hack-squat.html\">Machine Hack Squat</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/smith-machine-squat.html\">Smith Machine Squat</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely.</p>\n<p>Want to improve your squat?

    "tips": "<p>The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it's important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights.

You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pushing from the balls of your feet:</strong>&#160;This puts unnecessary strain&#160;on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaning forward:</strong>&#160;This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees come too far forward:</strong>&#160;When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Not squatting deep enough:</strong>&#160;Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees in or out:</strong>&#160;Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight.

    "overview": "<p>The deadlift is an extremely popular exercise and a true test of total body strength. It is popular across numerous weight lifting circle including bodybuilders, powerlifts, and Crossfit athletes.</p>\n<p>The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift. Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).</p>\n<p>The deadlift primarily works the muscles of the hamstrings. However, it is a complete compound exercise and also requires muscle activation from the back, glutes, hamstrings, arms, and core.</p>\n<p>The conventional deadlift shouldn’t be performed by just anyone as it involves a lot of technique and skill to execute. However, the hip-hinge movement pattern trained while performing a deadlift is and should be included in every <a href=\"/workout-routines\">workout program</a>.</p>\n<p>For those who cannot deadlift using the conventional pulling method, they can perform the exercise using one of the many deadlift variations out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of these deadlift variations include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/trap-bar-deadlift\">Trap Bar Deadlift</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/romanian-deadlift\">Romanian Deadlift</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/stiff-leg-deadlift-aka-romanian-deadlift.html\">Stiff Leg Deadlift</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/landmine-romanian-deadlift\">Landmine Deadlift</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/dumbbell-deadlift.html\">Dumbbell Deadlift</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/smith-machine-deadlift.html\">Smith Machine Deadlift</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grip strength is key to being able to deadlift a lot of weight and there are several grip variations you can use while deadlifting including: an overhand grip, mixed grip, and the hook grip.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nIn order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back.

    "overview": "<p>The Romanian deadlift, also known as the RDL, is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">conventional deadlift</a> and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the hamstrings and glutes.</p>\n<p>The RDL has long been thought of as the “leg” deadlift variation, despite all hip hinge movements primarily targeting the hamstrings. A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days.</p>\n<p>The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.</p>\n<p>The Romanian deadlift is best utilized during your <a href=\"/workouts/legs\">leg workouts</a> and/or <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nAssume a double overhand grip just outside of hip width and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nRange of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility&#160;to control that much range of motion effectively.</li>\n<li>\nIt is typically recommended that you utilize straps or hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nDo not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.</p>\n<p>For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body.</p>\n<p>By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.</p>\n<p>Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of these variations include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/incline-bench-press.html\">Incline bench press</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/decline-bench-press.html\">Decline bench press</a>,</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/dumbbell-bench-press.html\">Dumbbell bench press</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/incline-dumbbell-bench-press.html\">Dumbbell incline bench press</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/decline-dumbbell-bench-press.html\">Dumbbell decline bench press</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/exercises/smith-machine-bench-press.html\">Smith machine bench press</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nLie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nSet your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.</li>\n<li>\nLet the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nLower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.</li>\n<li>\nPush the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip.

Keep your head up and your back straight. This is the starting position.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forward&#160;slowly lower your body down.

You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\nAlways push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\nNever lean forward. This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.</li>\n<li>\nUsing squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\nDon't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.</li>\n<li>\nNever look down.&#160;As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you start the deadlift with your hips too high you will be at a mechanical disadvantage and will tax your lower back. Starting with your hips too low will also cause you to lose your leverage and power.</li>\n<li>\nIf you start the deadlift while looking down, there is a good chance your hips will lift up causing you to lose form and lift with your lower back. This is a very common deadlift mistake. Think about exploding your head upward while trying to stand erect. The body will follow the head.</li>\n<li>\nAs the weight gets heavy, lifting straps can be used to lift more weight than your grip strength would allow.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "overview": "<p>The dumbbell floor press is a variation of the floor press and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the triceps and chest.</p>\n<p>Primarily, the dumbbell floor press will target the muscles of the triceps. The limited range of motion effectively takes the chest somewhat out of the equation of the press.</p>\n<p>However, the chest can still be indirectly targeted when using the floor press. Simply focus on squeezing the pecs at the top of the movement.</p>\n<p>Floor presses, in generally, are particular helpful for those looking to build stronger triceps to help with locking out more compound press variations. They can also be beneficial for bodybuilders trying to add mass to their triceps.</p>\n",

You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\nAlways push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\nNever lean forward. This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.</li>\n<li>\nUsing squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\nNever look down.

If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nSome lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise.

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>You can utilize a bench for this variation but it may be slightly more uncomfortable on the ankle joint. As such, it may be wiser to use the pad on the leg extension machine or perhaps the squat pad attached to a bar at a lower height. Ideally the back foot should be positioned at knee height or slightly below. Setting the back foot too high will likely just drive your lumbar spine into excessive extension.</li>\n<li>If you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.</li>\n<li>If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.</li>\n<li>If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your spine neutral and load the front leg more effectively.</li>\n<li>If the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.</li>\n<li>You don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement.

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The trap bar deadlift is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">deadlift</a> and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the hamstrings. It will also indirectly target the other muscles of the leg, as well as the lats, forearms, traps, and lower back.</p>\n<p>The trap bar deadlift is often seen as a quad dominant variation of the deadlift, and while it does incorporate the quads to a larger degree than some other deadlift variations, it still is a hip hinge movement. And hip hinges should be primarily felt through the hamstrings and glutes.</p>\n<p>The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.</p>\n<p>The trap bar deadlift is best utilized during your <a href=\"/workouts/legs\">leg workouts</a> and/or <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nStand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nStance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.</li>\n<li>\nIn order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nGiven most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nStance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.</li>\n<li>\nThe sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.</li>\n<li>\nIn order to prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

A smart option, to increase training frequency and work on the movement pattern, would be to perform RDLs on your leg day and another deadlift variation on your back or pull days.</p>\n<p>The hip hinge is a crucial movement pattern, so it is important to find a variation that is comfortable for you to perform (if able), and work on it.</p>\n<p>The landmine implement provides a somewhat fixed movement pattern to take some of the stress of the stabilizing muscle groups to help emphasize hamstring usage and limit potential injuries from other variations.</p>\n<p>The landmine RDL is best utilized during your <a href=\"/workouts/legs\">leg workouts</a> and/or <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nStand with a bar in between your legs and lay the bar in the notch of a v-bar with both hands on the handle.</li>\n<li>\nStand tall and begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nRange of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nGrasp a kettlebell by the horns with a double overhand grip and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nRange of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the range of motion to control that much range of motion effectively.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nDo not allow the kettlebell to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell&#160;and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell.</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Using lifting straps will also allow you to lift heavier than your grip strength will allow.</li>\n<li>The biggest mistake you can make is trying to perform deadlifts from an unnatural body position. Read and re-read the form tips presented in this guide and practice them with a moderate weight. Start the deadlift with the hips in a position of strength and maximal leverage.</li>\n<li>If you start the deadlift with your hips too high you will be at a mechanical disadvantage and will tax your lower back. Starting with your hips too low will also cause you to lose your leverage and power. If you start the deadlift while looking down, there is a good chance your hips will lift causing you to lose form and lift with your lower back. This is a very common deadlift mistake. Think about exploding your head upward while trying to stand erect. The body will follow the head.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise.

You will take an aggressively wide stance and point your feet further out than you would with a regular squat.&#160;Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.</li>\n<li>\nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.</li>\n<li>\nNow take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability. You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nTake a small step back and stabilize yourself while positioning your feet wider than shoulder width and pointing them out.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down.

You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\nDon't push from the balls of your feet. This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\nDon't lean forward.&#160;This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\nDon't allow your knees to come too far forward.&#160;When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.</li>\n<li>\nUsing squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\nNever look down!&#160;As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. &#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Common mistakes when squatting:</strong> &#160;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Rounding the lower back:</strong>&#160;It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pushing from the balls of your feet:</strong>&#160;This puts unnecessary straight on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaning forward:</strong>&#160;This happens when your hip move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this, keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees come too far forward:</strong>&#160;When you squat down your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Not squatting deep enough:</strong>&#160;Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees in or out:</strong>&#160;Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight.

This is a great exercise if you’re looking to create a lot of stretch and tension on the hamstrings.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition a kettlebell on either side of your feet and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp each handle using a neutral grip.</li>\n<li>\nDrop your hips below your shoulders and ensure there is no slack in your arm.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away by extending the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the kettlebells to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n</ol>\n"

The movement will also indirectly target the muscles of the chest and shoulders.</p>\n<p>The close grip bench press is a superior movement when we’re talking about exercises that will pack mass onto your triceps. That said, use of close grips can provide some shoulder and elbow discomfort for some.</p>\n<p>This exercise can be included in your <a href=\"/workouts/triceps\">tricep workouts</a>, push workouts, upper body workouts, and <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nLie flat on an incline bench and set your hands at shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nSet your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.</li>\n<li>\nLet the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nLower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.</li>\n<li>\nPush the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The one arm kettlebell swing is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/kettlebell-swing\">kettlebell swing</a> and a total body movement that primarily works the muscles of the posterior chain, emphasizing the hamstring complex.</p>\n<p>The one arm kettlebell swing is an excellent starting point for those learning the hip hinge movement pattern. From there one can progress to more advanced hip hinges such as the <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">deadlift</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nAssume a hinged position with your knees slightly bent, one hand on the kettlebell handle, chin tucked, and weight centered over your foot. Utilize your free hand to help assist with balance.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the movement by hiking the kettlebell between your legs and keeping your spine neutral.</li>\n<li>\nDrive the kettlebell back to the starting position by extending the hips, pushing through the floor, and keeping the arms straight.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe swing should be a fairly explosive and snappy movement, the point is to generate hip extension as rapidly as possible followed by a subsequent contraction.</li>\n<li>\nImagine you’re trying to hike a football between your legs as the kettlebell descends.</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will obviously shift to your heels during the bottom portion of the exercise but you shouldn’t allow the toes to rise.</li>\n<li>\nYour chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nKeep a soft bend in your knees and don’t allow your arches to collapse as you complete the movement.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSet up for the wide squat by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.</li>\n<li>\nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.</li>\n<li>\nNow take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.</li>\n<li>\nYou should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nMove your feet apart, wide than shoulder width, with your toes pointing out slightly.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nTake a small step back and stabilize yourself.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down.&#160;Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.</li>\n<li>\nSquat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels.</li>\n<li>\nDo not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nExercise Tips:</h3>\n<p>The wide squat is a variation of the barbell squat. The are many mistakes that can be made when squatting, so it's important that you have your technique down before you attempt squatting heavy weights. If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. &#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Common mistakes when squatting:</strong> &#160;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Rounding the lower back.</strong> It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pushing from the balls of your feet.</strong> This puts unnecessary straight on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaning forward.</strong> This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees come too far forward</strong>. When you squat down&#160;your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Not squatting deep enough</strong>. Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees in or out</strong>. Don't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Looking down</strong>. As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "overview": "<p>The 2 board bench press is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/barbell-bench-press.html\">bench press</a> and an exercise used to increase strength in the muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders.</p>\n<p>Using boards allows you to overload the top portion of the bench press. This can be especially helpful if you’re trying to train the lockout portion of the lift but get stuck when touching the chest.</p>\n<p>Board presses are primarily used by strength competitors and the powerlifting community, but can also be used by anyone trying to build a bigger bench press for whatever reason.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nLie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nSet your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off to maintain tightness through your upper back.</li>\n<li>\nLet the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nLower the bar in a straight line until it touches a double board that is being held to your chest by a spotter.</li>\n<li>\nPush the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nSome lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The barbell Sumo Romanian deadlift is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/romanian-deadlift\">Romanian deadlift</a> and an exercise used to target the muscles of the hamstring complex, as well as the rest of the posterior chain.</p>\n<p>The Sumo Romanian deadlift is a combination exercise that incorporates both a <a href=\"/exercises/sumo-deadlift\">Sumo deadlift</a> and Romanian deadlift.</p>\n<p>The Sumo portion of the barbell Sumo Romanian deadlift is seen in the feet and hand placement of the set up. The Romanian deadlift portion is seen in the hip hinge movement pattern of the exercise.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).</li>\n<li>\nAssume a double overhand grip directly underneath your shoulders and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTypically the RDL begins with the bar set in a rack but for the sumo variation, it will likely be easier to start with the bar on the floor to get your feet in a comfortable position during the setup.</li>\n<li>\nRange of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively.</li>\n<li>\nIt is typically recommended that you utilize straps or hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nDo not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Use of the landmine provides a fix plane of motion for the lifter to complete the exercise in. It also challenges the grip strength of the lifter who now must grasp the thickest portion of the barbell.</p>\n<p>The other difference is the fact that the landmine single leg Romanian deadlift is a unilateral exercise.

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nStand perpendicular to a barbell in a landmine attachment.</li>\n<li>\nGrasp the end of the bar with one hand and stand tall.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the RDL by lifting one foot, unlocking your knee, and slowly hinging back into your hip.</li>\n<li>\nPush through the floor and extend the hip as you return to the starting position.</li>\n<li>\nReset and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nFocus on pushing your heel back as far as possible and hinging into the hip rather than dropping your chest.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t allow the hips to rotate, you should be able to balance a cup of water on your back in the bottom of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nYour chin should follow your chest, don’t worry about looking up in the bottom of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should keep a straight line from your head through your heel.</li>\n<li>\nKeep a soft bend in your knee and don’t allow your arch to collapse as you complete the movement.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nTo learn and master single RDLs, it may be conducive to utilize assisted versions by lightly holding onto a rack with your free hand or hinging with both legs in position like a normal RDL but keep one foot hovering off the floor.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find one glute has less contractility than another, perform the movement unilaterally and then incorporate the bilateral version after you have accumulated sufficient volume on the side with poor contractility.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Learn to walk before you try to run.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.</li>\n<li>\nIf you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your neutral and load the front leg more effectively.</li>\n<li>\nIf the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.</li>\n<li>\nYou don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral.</li>\n</ol>\n"

There shouldn’t be any movement within your spine - don’t focus on arching your back.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nDo not worry about retracting your shoulder blades, this is unnecessary and doesn’t carry over to your deadlift.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you hip hinge, you should naturally notice a weight shift to your heels. However, don’t shift your weight so aggressively that your heels come up.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbows doesn’t break neutral.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe deep squat is a variation of the regular squat.&#160;The difference is that instead of lowering your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor, you&#160;squat down as far as possible. This brings the glutes and hamstrings into the exercise more. Deep squats are more challenging that regular squats! Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.</li>\n<li>\nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart. Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.</li>\n<li>\nNow take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.</li>\n<li>\nYou should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nTake a small step back and stabilize yourself.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forwards, slowly lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down.&#160;Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.</li>\n<li>\nSquat down as far as possible, pushing your knees slightly outwards creating a \"hole\" for you to lower into.

If you are squatting correctly, you should not feel pain in your lower back. Lower back pain is usually a sign that you are not using correct form and/or your core is weak. &#160;</p>\n<p><strong>Common mistakes when squatting:</strong> &#160;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Rounding the lower back:</strong>&#160;It's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pushing from the balls of your feet:</strong>&#160;This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaning forward:</strong>&#160;This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this, keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees come too far forward:</strong>&#160;When you squat down your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Not squatting deep enough:</strong>&#160;Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Knees in or out:</strong>&#160;Don't point your knees in or when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Looking down:</strong>&#160;As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that. &#160;</li>\n</ol>\n",

They can be used to help beginners learn the proper form of a back squat by providing an external cue to let lifters know when to reverse the movement.</p>\n<p>Box squats also serve rehabilitation purposes, especially for those coming off knee injuries or those learning how to <a href=\"/articles/how-to-fix-buttwink-squats\">eliminate the butt wink</a> during squats.</p>\n<p>The dumbbell goblet squat can serve a similar purpose. They are also helpful in that they bring the weight in front of the body which can help lifters who struggle to maintain an upright torso during the <a href=\"/exercises/squat.html\">squat</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, the dumbbell goblet box squat is perfect for those rehabilitating from injury or learning the squat movement pattern.</p>\n",

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm&#160;to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nSome lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise.</li>\n<li>It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set).</li>\n<li>You do not have to use an overhand grip on the bar. You can use an underhand grip or one over / one under.</li>\n<li>During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.</li>\n<li>Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal&#160;tight as you begin the ascent.</li>\n<li>Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!</li>\n<li>One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back.</li>\n<li>Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, use a very light weight (or bar only) and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!</li>\n</ul>\n"

Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.</li>\n<li>Picking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.</li>\n<li>There’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.</li>\n<li>If you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).</li>\n<li>Don’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the handle and don’t utilize a false grip.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar nears your hips and your legs lock out, shrug the shoulders and then pull aggressively with the arms.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should rise to sternum level at the completion of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar returns back to the hip position, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nStance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.</li>\n<li>\nThe sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats in order to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin, especially in the sumo deadlift.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The Reeves deadlift is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">deadlift</a> and an exercise that strengthens all of the muscles of the posterior chain including your hamstrings, back, glutes, traps, and calves.</p>\n<p>What makes the Reeves deadlift unique when compared to other variations of the deadlift is its unique hand placement. For the Reeves deadlift, one pinches the plates instead of grasping the bar. This twist to the exercise aims to increase one’s grip strength.</p>\n<p>The Reeves deadlift is perfect for those looking to build superior grip strength or as an accessory exercise in building an overall better deadlift.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the plates with just your fingers using a semi neutral grip.</li>\n<li>\nDrop the hips and set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits).</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nGiven the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor.

In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy.

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nBy adding bands to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the bands will stretch most in the bottom and least at the top. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the assistance from the band, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the floor.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you would want to attach two bands across the bar using pegs on a deadlift platform or rack. However, if that option isn’t available, you can simply loop a single band around the end, stretch it underneath the plates, and then loop it around the other side.\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf that isn’t comfortable, you can also stand on one end of the band, wrap it around the bar, and step on the other end. This option is slightly more dangerous though as there is a good chance that the band might slide out from underneath your feet and present a potential injury risk. Again, this will depend upon the available equipment but ideally try to prioritize safety over everything.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

However, the feet stay in one place for the most part during this exercise. Thus, some may refer to the split squat as a static lunge.</p>\n<p>By holding the dumbbell like a goblet, as seen in the dumbbell goblet split squat, you are better able to keep an upright torso during the movement. This can be helpful for those who experience an excessive forward lean during other variations.</p>\n",

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nIf you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.</li>\n<li>\nIf you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your neutral and load the front leg more effectively.</li>\n<li>\nIf the front leg keeps diving in excessively as you reverse from the eccentric to concentric, attach a band to a rack, loop one end around your knee, and allow it to pull you into a valgus position (not excessively, just slightly). From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.</li>\n<li>\nYou don’t need to feel like you have to be completely upright as you complete the movement. On the contrary, you should have a slight forward lean and focus on keeping your lumbar spine neutral.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Set the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.</li>\n<li>\nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.</li>\n<li>\nNow take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.</li>\n<li>\nYou should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nTake a small step back and stabilize yourself. Now carefully extend your right leg behind you and place the top of your foot securely on the bench.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forwards slowly lower your body down by bending at the left knee.&#160;</li>\n<li>\nDon't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.</li>\n<li>\nSquat down until your left thigh&#160;is parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heel.</li>\n<li>\nDo not lock the knee&#160;out when you stand up.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for desired&#160;reps and then repeat using your right leg.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nExercise Tips:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nStart this exercise my using a very light weight. You will have to balance on one foot while placing the opposite foot on the bench so master this movement before going up in weight.</li>\n<li>\nThe higher you raise the platform, the more challenging the exercise becomes.</li>\n<li>\nIt's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\nAlways push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\nDon't allow your torso to lean forward. This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.</li>\n<li>\nKeep your head up and look forward.&#160;As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nStand on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a double overhand snatch grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nFor a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nGiven the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats&#160;to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off&#160;to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ul>\n<li>The reverse grip bench press is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/barbell-bench-press.html\">barbell bench press</a>. Rep timing should be slow enough that you control the weight on the way down. Letting the weight drop really quickly is not productive because the muscles do not have to work as hard on the negative phase of the movement. This makes the exercise less effective.</li>\n<li>Keep your feet firmly planted on the floor. Your feet provide the stabilization for the lift, if you hold them up or move them around you're more likely to lose balance.</li>\n<li>Make sure you lower the bar straight down to your middle chest and push it straight up. Don't deviate from this range of motion.</li>\n<li>Your glutes and shoulder blades should be touching the bench at all times throughout the set. It's OK to arch the back as long as the glutes and shoulder blades are fixed.</li>\n<li>Never \"bounce\" the weight off of your chest.</li>\n</ul>\n"

This can be especially helpful if you’re looking to build a bigger deadlift, but struggle at lock out.</p>\n<p>Block pull deadlifts are mostly seen among powerlifters, but can be helpful for other populations looking to build muscle as well.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nLoad the bar on a set of blocks or risers.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nUsing blocks allows you to overload the&#160;top half of the range of motion given the shortened range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot&#160;to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nJump and reach up as high as you can to start.</li>\n<li>\nPull your knees up to your chest and ensure the rope wraps under one foot and over the other before you squeeze your legs together.</li>\n<li>\nWhile pinching your feet together, extend your legs and pull with your arms to scale upwards along the rope.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat the process until you reach the top of the rope.</li>\n<li>\nTo descend, loosen your grip slightly and allow yourself to slide down the rope in a controlled fashion.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you reach the starting position, repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nInitially you may need to utilize the feet&#160;to help propel yourself upwards, especially if your upper body strength is lagging. However, as you get stronger you should work on using the legs less and even progressing to an entirely upper body pull. If you become extremely advanced, you can hold the legs in an L sit while you make the climb.</li>\n<li>\nGiven your having to support your full bodyweight with one hand during a specific point of the pull, these can be used as a progression to single arm pullups.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure that you’re using the feet correctly as they will provide much of the force which propels your body upwards.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t complete normal bodyweight pullups or chinups then do not attempt to climb a rope on your own.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure you have a heavy pad of some sort underneath the rope if you’re just learning in case your hands slip.</li>\n<li>\nChalk is especially important for rope climbs as your hands get sweaty.</li>\n<li>\nIf your hands get especially torn up from descending the rope and allowing yourself to slide down, you can wear gloves if desired.</li>\n<li>\nDO NOT jump down from the top of the rope once you’re done climbing.

The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot.

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”).

This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nSome lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nAssume a slightly wider than shoulder width stance and clean two kettlebells to your shoulders with a neutral or slightly pronated grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and complete a normal front squat with the kettlebells in place by simultaneously flexing the knees and hips together.</li>\n<li>\nPress your whole foot into the floor and extend the legs.</li>\n<li>\nAs you return to the starting position, utilize your momentum from the front squat to propel the kettlebells upward into a push press.</li>\n<li>\nExhale once the kettlebells gets to lockout and reverse the movement slowly while controlling the kettlebells back to your shoulders.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "overview": "<p>The archer pull up is a more advanced variation of the traditional pull up and is used to target the lat and bicep muscles.</p>\n<p>The archer pull up incorporates a slight unilateral effect, allowing the lifter to emphasize one lat at a time. This allows the lifter to really focus on the concentric hold of each lat to help develop the mind-muscle connection. The hold and shift also increases the time under tension of the muscle, which can help in building bigger lats.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nUsing a pronated grip, grasp the pull up bar with a slightly wider than shoulder width grip.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats.</li>\n<li>\nPull your chin towards one side of the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly shift to the other side of the bar without changing the height of your body. Once the shift is complete, lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTo decrease bicep involvement, use a false (thumbless grip).</li>\n<li>\nTry to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine.</li>\n<li>\nIf the bar is high enough, keep the legs straight and in front of the body in a hollow body position.</li>\n<li>\nAvoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs.</li>\n<li>\nThe pull up is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs. When this occurs, the elbows will flare up behind the body, the shoulder will round forward, and you’ll begin to feel pressure in the front of your shoulders.</li>\n<li>\nA lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone.</li>\n<li>\nLower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t complete a single bodyweight pull up, start with slow negatives (add weight when these can be accomplished under control) or flexed arm hangs in the top position.</li>\n<li>\nDitch the straps and kips, neither one is necessary or recommended.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The trap bar rack pull is a variation of the rack pull and an exercise used to target the lower back, as well as the rest of the posterior chain.</p>\n<p>The trap bar rack pull, and other rack pull variations, can help a lifter isolate their lower back. It can also assist in building greater <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">deadlift</a> strength by training the lock out portion of the movement, a common sticking point for a lot of lifters.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the trap bar rack pull and other rack pull variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.</p>\n<p>These slight changes seen in the trap bar rack pull can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSet up the bar at just below knee height on the safety pins in a rack.</li>\n<li>\nStand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward. Reach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the pins, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nStance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot in order to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

A snatch grip Romanian deadlift takes a larger width grip. Doing so places more tension on the trapezius muscles, as well as challenges one’s grip strength.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nAssume a double overhand snatch grip and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.</li>\n<li>\nBegin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nRange of motion in the lift will largely be determined by an individual’s mobility as well as their ability to maintain a neutral spine. Standing on a box or bench is likely counterproductive as most won’t have the mobility to control that much range of motion effectively.</li>\n<li>\nIt is typically recommended that you utilize straps or a hook grip when going excessively heavy if grip is the limiting factor as you could run into issues with the bar drifting if using mixed grip.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nDo not allow the bar to drift away from the body, it should graze your legs during the eccentric portion of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nYour weight will naturally shift to your heels as you hinge; however, it’s important that you keep the weight distributed over your whole foot and don’t allow the toes to rise. To combat this, you should focus on maintaining 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n</ol>\n"

This can be especially helpful if you’re looking to build a bigger deadlift, but struggle at lock out.</p>\n<p>Snatch grip block pull deadlifts are mostly seen among powerlifters and Olympic weight lifters, but can be helpful for other populations looking to build muscle as well.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nLoad the bar on a set of blocks or risers.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a double overhand snatch grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nUsing blocks allows you to overload the&#160;top half of the range of motion given the shortened range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nGiven the grip width, you may need to incorporate straps when the weight becomes significant.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumbs around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nThe knees should be stacked over the feet. If you position the feet too wide (outside of hip width) then you will likely have to resort to one of two strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe knees will be pushed inward (valgus) due to your grip width.</li>\n<li>\nYou will have to widen your grip which will require a larger range of motion and make the lift less efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSet up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.&#160;</li>\n<li>\nStand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.</li>\n<li>\nPosition the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn't, try adding some padding to the bar.</li>\n<li>\nNow take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.</li>\n<li>\nYou should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack. Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.</li>\n<li>\nTake a small step back and stabilize yourself.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your eyes facing forward&#160;lower your body down. Don't lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.</li>\n<li>\nSquat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then&#160;raise your body back up by pushing through your heels.&#160;</li>\n<li>\nDo not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement with a quick and smooth pace.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nExercise Tips:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nUse a lighter weight and perform this exercise as quickly as possible without breaking form.</li>\n<li>\nIt's crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.</li>\n<li>\nAlways push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward.</li>\n<li>\nUsing squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li>\nDon't point your knees in or out when you're lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.</li>\n<li>\nKeep your head up.&#160;As soon as you look down your back rounds, simple as that.</li>\n</ol>\n",

The resistance band will help provide constant tension during the exercise, amplifying resistance towards the top of the movement.</p>\n<p>The landmine allows the bar to travel in a somewhat fixed plane of motion. And since the band resistance single arm landmine press is unilateral by nature, it will allow you to isolate each deltoid to a greater degree.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nWrap one end of a band around the end of the barbell and secure the other end underneath your foot.</li>\n<li>\nAssume a standing position with your spine neutral and feet shoulder width apart.</li>\n<li>\nShoulder the barbell in one hand and place your other hand on your ribcage to monitor spinal positioning.</li>\n<li>\nOnce the barbell is in place, take a deep breath and press to lockout by extending the elbow and flexing the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nSlowly lower the barbell back to the starting position on your shoulder and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nPress with the contralateral arm compared to the knee in flexion (e.g. if your left leg is in flexion, the barbell should be in your right hand).</li>\n<li>\nDon’t allow the head to jut forward excessively.</li>\n<li>\nDrive the bicep to the ear and exhale as you press.</li>\n<li>\nIf you sense any pressure in your neck or traps during the movement, look to address a lack of thoracic spine extension or shoulder flexion.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping the elbows slightly bent at the top and not locking out entirely will help to keep tension on the shoulders.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t lock out the elbows overhead than it may indicate a lack of shoulder mobility due to poor scapular upward rotation.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the rib cage stays down and you’re not falling into excessive hyperextension.</li>\n<li>\nUtilize a staggered stance to prevent yourself from overarching as you press.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSelect your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance.</li>\n<li>\nLoad the desired weight on the bar and then loop chains around the end of the barbell.</li>\n<li>\nLie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nSet your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off&#160;to maintain tightness through your upper back.</li>\n<li>\nLet the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nLower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.</li>\n<li>\nPush the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nEnsure the chains are loaded on the ends of the bar and that some links are still touching the floor at the top of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nBy adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck off the chest.</li>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.</li>\n<li>\nAs the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.</li>\n<li>\nIntermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.</li>\n<li>\nFight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.</li>\n<li>\nSqueeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.</li>\n<li>\nSome lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.</li>\n<li>\nThink about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.</li>\n<li>\nTightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.</li>\n<li>\nFocus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nThe glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTechnique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.</li>\n<li>\nIf you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.</li>\n<li>\nArching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.</li>\n<li>\nThe bar should touch your chest with every single repetition.

Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.</li>\n<li>\nLow bar positioning will require the lifter to sit back into the hips with more forward lean at the torso to recruit the posterior chain more effectively.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<p>Performing the dumbbell stiff leg deadlift on a bench allows for a greater range of motion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by placing two flat benches together side by side.

Your knees should be kept stationary during the movement.</li>\n<li>Focus on the stretch in your hamstrings, and continue to lower the dumbbells down as far as your hamstrings will let you comfortably.</li>\n<li>Now engage the hamstrings and begin to raise the dumbbells straight back up.</li>\n<li>Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding.</li>\n<li>Squeeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up.</li>\n<li>Repeat for desired reps.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ul>\n<li>You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round.</li>\n<li>The dumbbells need to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the dumbbells are from your body the more strain is on your lower back.</li>\n<li>Focus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the dumbbells and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise.</li>\n<li>It's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set).</li>\n<li>During the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.</li>\n<li>Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back, and abdominal&#160;tight as you begin the ascent.</li>\n<li>Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!</li>\n<li>One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back.</li>\n<li>Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!</li>\n</ul>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The trap bar deficit deadlift is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/trap-bar-deadlift\">trap bar deadlift</a> and an exercise used to target the muscles of the posterior chain.</p>\n<p>The main difference between the trap bar deficit deadlift and other <a href=\"/exercises/deadlifts.html\">deadlift</a> variations is the hand placement and use of a trap bar. The trap bar allows the lifter to maintain a more neutral grip as well as the weight distribution from the front of the body to the side of the body.</p>\n<p>These slight changes seen in the trap bar deficit deadlift can help the lifter maintain a more neutral spine during the course of the movement.</p>\n<p>The trap bar deficit deadlift also elevates the lifter, increasing the range of motion of the lift, and the total time under tension of the targeted muscle groups.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nStand inside of the trap bar with a hip width stance on a 1-2.5” platform which elevates your feet slightly off the floor.</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip outside of shoulder width.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nFor a deficit pull, you want to keep the deficit anywhere from 1-2.5 inches if you’re going to be using it regularly. Any higher and it’ll put you in a knees forward position which can alter your technique if used in the long run.</li>\n<li>\nStance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nGiven most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts. You would also need additional supplementary work for the upper back and glutes.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The alternating single leg jump rope is a cardio exercise used to condition the entire body.</p>\n<p>Jumping rope in general requires and builds a lot of coordination, one of the most important components to human fitness.</p>\n<p>Jump rope exercises, such as the alternating single leg jump rope, are great calf building exercises as they provide a lot of repetition to the slow twitch muscle fibers of the calves and can be explosive by nature.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nGrasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels.</li>\n<li>\nRotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body.</li>\n<li>\nAs the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one leg to allow it to pass underneath.</li>\n<li>\nComplete another rotation of the rope and hop with the opposite foot.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat step 3 and 4 continuously for the desired number of repetitions or time.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nHopping on a single leg requires quite a bit of hip and ankle stability. As such, if you encounter knee pain or you notice that your biomechanics are altered, consider utilize a bilateral version and working to increase your single leg strength via training.</li>\n<li>\nKeep a loose grip on the rope with the fingers relaxed just enough to keep the handle from flying out of your hand.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure most of the movement comes from the wrists preferentially.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t look down or hunch over as the rope circles around your body. Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.</li>\n<li>\nPicking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.</li>\n<li>\nThere’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).</li>\n<li>\nDon’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n"

If the elbows are bent then you will load the hips more as you effectively take the upper back out of the equation given you’re shortening the lever arm and taking the shoulders out of flexion.

Not maximal load, some load. Keep it light enough that it doesn’t affect your technique.</li>\n<li>If you find the front of the sled digging into the floor then you may need to grip slightly lower on the handles and/or ensure that your torso is inclined properly. If you start to get too upright then the sled will likely tilt forward and you’ll increase drag against the floor.</li>\n<li>If you don’t have access to a sled, you can push a car or even a plate across astroturf.</li>\n<li>Some prefer to push with the head down while others would rather look up.

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nGrasp a jump rope with the handles at your sides and the rope behind your heels.</li>\n<li>\nRotate the wrists to generate velocity and help the rope revolve around the body.</li>\n<li>\nAs the rope moves toward your feet, hop with one leg to allow it to pass underneath.</li>\n<li>\nWhen you land, try to move in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion and complete a circle as you jump.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions or time.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nRemember to reverse the direction of the hops and also incorporate both directions on each leg.</li>\n<li>\nHopping on a single leg requires quite a bit of hip and ankle stability.

Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.</li>\n<li>\nPicking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.</li>\n<li>\nThere’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet. Conserve your energy for further jumps.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find that jumping rope aggravates your knees or ankles, seek out a more forgiving surface (rubber mat, grass, etc).</li>\n<li>\nDon’t forget to breath as you complete repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n"

The pause increases the time under tension of the targeted muscle groups and forces the lifter to really be able to control the weight they are using.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a very wide stance (determined by your hip structure and limb length).</li>\n<li>\nPush your hips back and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the bar using a shoulder width, double overhand grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the bar, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the bar.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nPause for a 2 count as soon as the plates break the floor.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe length and location of the pause will vary based upon your sticking point and what you’re trying to accomplish by utilizing the lift.</li>\n<li>\nStance width varies greatly depending upon the individual. Rather than spend too much time trying to calculate your ideal stance width, simply experiment and see what feels best on your hips in the long run while simultaneously allowing you to generate the most power. For some folks this will be a semi medium width (hybrid) position whereas for others their toes will almost be touching the plates.</li>\n<li>\nThe deadlift is a hinge, not a squat. If you set the hips too low you will put yourself in a disadvantageous position biomechanically and limit your potential for pulling maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nThe sumo pull is slightly different than conventional as the goal is to “wedge” your hips into the bar and get them as close as possible.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifters shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should cue and emphasize a vertical shin but this will depend entirely on a lifter’s spine and limb length.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nScraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.</li>\n<li>\nTo follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n</ol>\n"

This means the trap bar deadlift becomes more difficult the closer you get to lock out.</p>\n<p>As each chain link rises from the ground, more resistance will be applied to the bar. This can be especially helpful in overloading the top portion of the movement.</p>\n<p>Applying chains to lifts is commonly seen among powerlifters and sports-performance training, but can be applied to any training program if your goal is to <a href=\"/expert-guides/muscle-building\">build muscle</a> and strength.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSelect your weight and load the bar. Once the bar has been loaded, attach chains to the bar to add additional resistance.</li>\n<li>\nStep inside the trap bar, push your hips back, and hinge forward until your torso is nearly parallel with the floor.</li>\n<li>\nReach down and grasp the handles using a neutral grip.</li>\n<li>\nInhale and pull up slightly on the bar while allowing your hips to drop in a seesaw fashion. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as “pulling the slack out of the bar”.</li>\n<li>\nAs you drop the hips and pull up on the handles, set the lats (imagine you’re trying to squeeze oranges in your armpits) and ensure your armpits are positioned directly over the handles.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the bar tracks in a straight line as you extend the knees and hips.</li>\n<li>\nOnce you have locked out the hips, reverse the movement by pushing the hips back and hinging forward.</li>\n<li>\nReturn the bar to the floor, reset, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nEnsure that the chains are loaded on the end of the bar so that they don’t contact the plates as the bar is lowered.</li>\n<li>\nBy adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting off the floor.</li>\n<li>\nStance width should ideally resemble your typical jumping position. Place your feet in a stance that feels powerful and keeps the knees vertically aligned over the feet.</li>\n<li>\nTo prevent the bar from drifting away from the body, one should focus on squeezing their lats to keep the bar close and allow it to travel in a linear fashion. Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.</li>\n<li>\nThe hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”). The chest up cue is usually accomplished when the lats become locked in though so this cue is typically not needed if the lifter understands how to initiate the lats.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally the knees should be tracking out over the foot. If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor. In other words, imagine there is a crack in the floor and you’re trying to spread it open by pushing your heels away from each other. This will help to activate your glutes more during the movement and stabilize the knee joint.</li>\n<li>\nYou MUST keep the crease of the armpit over the bar and the midfoot to allow the bar to travel linearly.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual - Some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking slightly up. Here’s some factors to consider:\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you’re someone who is more globally extended (i.e. athletic background), then you will likely be able to keep a neutral position more effectively by packing the chin.</li>\n<li>\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you tend to be more flexion dominant (especially in your thoracic spine - upper back) then it would behoove you to look up slightly as this will drive more extension.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with each and see which one works best for your individual anatomy and biomechanics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nGiven most deadlift variations require a more vertical shin after the initial pull off the floor to allow the bar to move around the knees, the trap bar deadlift will actually require a more dorsiflexed position of the ankle at the start. In other words, the shins will be in a more angled position and more of the load will be displaced on the quads.</li>\n<li>\nMore experienced lifters may not need to emphasize the “pull the slack out the bar” cue as much and that’s perfectly fine if it works for them and still allows them to pull maximal weight but initially it’s an important concept to understand and implement.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - this will be dependent upon your hip anatomy. Experiment (toes slightly in, out, or neutral) to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nDo NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.</li>\n<li>\nMake sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure that the hands are positioned in the middle of the handles as this will ensure that the bar doesn’t tilt as you make your pull.</li>\n<li>\nIf you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.</li>\n<li>\nFor single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nPosition the bar just below shoulder level and adjust the safety stops right above knee height. Find a box set right at parallel and position 2-3 feet behind you.

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nEnsure that the chains are loaded on the ends of the bar and that some links are still touching the floor at the top of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nBy adding chains to the bar you will allow yourself to overload the top half of the movement given that the chains will elongate and add the most weight at the top of the movement. This allows you to use a weight you might not be able to manage for a full repetition normally but given the variable resistance from the chain, you are able to overload the lockout without getting stuck in the hole.</li>\n<li>\nToe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.</li>\n<li>\nBend the bar over your back by pulling it down into your traps.</li>\n<li>\nExperiment with a “false” (i.e. thumbless) grip as this helps to eliminate elbow and wrist issues in some folks.</li>\n<li>\nDrive through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.</li>\n<li>\nImagine you’re trying to drop your back pockets straight towards your heels. Down, not back.</li>\n<li>\nSome forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward. Those with longer femurs will have to allow their knees to come farther forward if they want to remain upright.</li>\n<li>\nDrive your traps into the bar and try to squeeze your elbows in towards your body as you reverse the movement out of the hole.</li>\n<li>\nNeck position is highly individual as well - some prefer a neutral neck position (i.e. keeping the chin tucked throughout the lift) while others do well with looking straight ahead. Experiment with each and see which one works best for your anatomy.</li>\n<li>\nLow bar positioning will require the lifter to sit back into the hips with more forward lean at the torso&#160;to recruit the posterior chain more effectively.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t push the knees out excessively but ensure they track roughly over or slightly outside the 2nd toe.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSecure a flat bench and select the desired weight from the rack.</li>\n<li>\nSit in an upright position and then hinge forward from the hips.</li>\n<li>\nAllow the arms to hang straight down from the shoulders with a neutral grip and dumbbells behind your calves.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and pull the dumbbells towards the ceiling using the rear deltoids.</li>\n<li>\nSlowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nIdeally we want to focus on the rear deltoids, not the scapular retractors so movement at the shoulder blade should be limited. Move the shoulder within the joint, not the shoulder blade on the ribcage.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the abs braced and don’t arch the back at the top of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nHinge as far as comfortably possible while completing the exercise. Or, you could also take a seated position to complete the exercise as well.</li>\n<li>\nIf you experience shoulder pain during the movement then it may be beneficial to rotate the dumbbells until the thumbs are pointing away from one another and the palms are facing forward. This is also known as a supinated grip and will externally rotate the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t jut your head forward during the movement - this is about stimulation for a small muscle group. Focus during the movement and don’t just rely on momentum.</li>\n<li>\nAllow the arms to move freely but don’t lock out the elbows.</li>\n</ol>\n"

If you need more, simply grip higher on the band.</li>\n<li>\nWhen extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back.

However, they do an excellent job at building hamstring muscle and strength which will have a positive carry over into your big leg exercises and aesthetics.</p>\n<p>The Nordic hamstring curl can be performed during your <a href=\"/workouts/legs\">leg workouts</a> and <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSetup in a nordic hamstring machine with your hips extended and torso upright.</li>\n<li>\nKeeping your hips extended, begin to lower yourself as slowly as possible until you can no longer control the descent.</li>\n<li>\nAt this point, allow yourself to fall to the floor in a controlled fashion and “catch” yourself with your arms.</li>\n<li>\nGive yourself just enough of a push off the floor to get back into a position where you can pull yourself back to the start using your hamstrings.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nIf have access to an actual nordic hamstring curl machine that would be ideal. If not, try to utilize a lat pulldown machine as that is the easiest option to adapt for setup. If neither option is available, consider the partner assisted version. If you don’t have access to anyone who can hold your ankles in place, consider a setup with a power rack whereby your ankles are positioned underneath the squat pad on a weighted barbell and you have a pad underneath your knees.</li>\n<li>\nIdeally you should look to keep your hips extended throughout the duration of the set, don’t allow them to shoot back and take tension off of your hamstrings.</li>\n<li>\nWhen extending the glutes, you shouldn’t feel any pressure or contraction through the lower back. If you find yourself getting a pump through your spinal erectors then you’re likely substituting spinal extension for hip extension.</li>\n<li>\nRemember, it’s a controlled drop when you can’t maintain tension with the hamstrings anymore. At that point you should still seek to keep the hamstrings active and&#160;only use the arms as necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The side lying rear delt fly is a shoulder exercise used to target the rear delts.</p>\n<p>It is a great unilateral exercise to use to target a smaller and often lagging muscle group.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSecure a flat bench and select the desired weight from the rack.</li>\n<li>\nHold one dumbbell directly in front of you while side lying against the bench. Use your free hand to support your head and bend your knees slightly to allow the bench to support your weight.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath and pull the dumbbell towards the ceiling using the rear deltoid.</li>\n<li>\nSlowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position under control.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nIdeally we want to focus on the rear deltoids, not the scapular retractors so movement at the shoulder blade should be limited. Move the shoulder within the joint, not the shoulder blade on the ribcage.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the abs braced and don’t arch the back at the top of the movement.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t hinge to 90 degrees, then hinge as far as comfortably possible while completing the exercise. Or, you could also take a seated position to complete the exercise as well.</li>\n<li>\nIf you experience shoulder pain during the movement then it may be beneficial to rotate the dumbbells until the thumbs are pointing away from one another and the palms are facing forward. This is also known as a supinated grip and will externally rotate the shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t jut your head forward during the movement - this is about stimulation for a small muscle group. Focus during the movement and don’t just rely on momentum.</li>\n<li>\nAllow the arms to move freely but don’t lock out the elbows.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The decline cable fly is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/cable-crossovers-%28mid-chest%29.html\">cable chest fly</a> and an exercise used to strengthen the pushing muscles of the body including the chest, triceps, and shoulders.</p>\n<p>The decline cable fly is particularly good for targeting the stubborn lower portion of your pec muscles. The exercise is best used as an accessory movement to your heavy compound lifts.</p>\n<p>This movement can be included into your <a href=\"/workouts/chest\">chest workouts</a>, push workouts, upper body workouts, or <a href=\"/workouts/full-body\">full body workouts</a>.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nSet both pulleys as low as possible, position a decline bench in the cable station, and select the desired weight.</li>\n<li>\nSit on the end of the flat bench and grasp one handle at a time. Lay back and get into position while holding the handles at chest height.</li>\n<li>\nPress the handles to lockout while flexing the pecs and extending the elbows.</li>\n<li>\nKeep a slight bend in the elbows, move entirely at the shoulder joint, and slowly allow the arms to open while the pecs stretch.</li>\n<li>\nReturn to the starting position by flexing your pecs and bringing the handles together at chest height.</li>\n<li>\nSlowly lower back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nImagine you’re trying to hug a tree while completing the exercise.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t squeeze the handles excessively tight as this can over recruit the forearms and biceps thereby reducing activation of the pecs.</li>\n<li>\nAvoid touching or banging the handles together at peak contraction to keep constant tension on the intended muscle groups.</li>\n<li>\nAlways keep a slight bend in the elbows and never lower the weight to the point where you get any sort of pain and pressure at the front of the shoulder joint.</li>\n<li>\nEnsure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to arch excessively.</li>\n</ol>\n"

Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!</li>\n<li>One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips will naturally move back.</li>\n<li>Technique is so important with this exercise. If you're just starting out, stand with your side to a mirror with a very light weight (or bar only) and practice the movement. Once you get the technique nailed you'll be able to move up in weight and start building some killer hams and glutes!</li>\n</ul>\n"

This means, you’re less likely to cheat as you would if trying to increase weight used in a weighted exercise.

Once you are supine, press the weight to lockout.</li>\n<li>\nUnlock the elbows and allow the ez bar to drop toward your forehead or just above.</li>\n<li>\nOnce your forearms reach parallel or just below, allow the upper arms to extend overhead (similar to a pullover).</li>\n<li>\nAs the arms reach full extension, pull the elbows back to the starting position and then extend the elbows while flexing the triceps to lockout the weight.</li>\n<li>\nRepeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nDon’t overextend through the lumbar spine, keep your ribcage down by maintaining tension through the abs and glutes.</li>\n<li>\nUsing a slow eccentric (lowering portion) of the exercise can help to improve tension and mind muscle connection.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the head in a fairly neutral position, don’t allow the neck to jut forward as this may place excessive pressure on the cervical spine.</li>\n<li>\nIn order to keep tension on the triceps, don’t lock out the elbows completely.</li>\n<li>\nIf you experience elbow pain during the movement, consider implementing a slight angle (incline or decline) or adjust elbow position (in versus out).</li>\n<li>\nYou may slightly reduce tension through the ligamentous portions of the triceps during the movement by keeping the bar just above your head and not locking out directly over your line of sight.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "overview": "<p>The reverse flys on rings is a variation of the <a href=\"/exercises/bent-over-dumbbell-reverse-fly.html\">reverse fly</a> and an exercise used to target the muscles of the shoulder. More specifically, the reverse fly on rings targets the rear deltoid and includes some involvement from the upper back and traps.</p>\n<p>By utilizing rings, you allow your bodyweight and gravity to be the load your rear deltoids have to bear. Since the exercise itself is a self-limiting exercise, you’ll run a slightly lesser risk of injuring yourself while performing reverse flys on rings.</p>\n",
    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nAdjust a set of rings to roughly chest height.</li>\n<li>\nSit down beneath the rings and grasp them with a neutral grip.</li>\n<li>\nDrive your heels into the ground, extend your hips, and keep your arms locked out. Your body should be in a straight line with your arms perpendicular to your torso.</li>\n<li>\nPull the rings apart as your keep your elbows slightly bent.</li>\n<li>\nSlowly lower yourself back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTo scale the movement, one may have to lower or raise the height of the rings. The closer you are to perpendicular with the floor, the tougher the movement will be.</li>\n<li>\nIf regular repetitions with just bodyweight are too easy, progress by elevating the feet or adding a weight vest/plate to the torso. You can also use an old bookbag if you have it lying around but you should load this on the front of the body instead of the back as that can pull you into excessive extension.</li>\n<li>\nFor other forms of progression, you can add fat grips or utilize single arm versions but just remember, this is about movement quality. Just because an exercise is hard doesn’t mean it’s better, work within your wheelhouse and don’t force progression if you haven’t mastered the fundamentals.</li>\n<li>\nDon’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull.</li>\n<li>\nKeep the ribcage down and don’t focus on arching the back or forcing the chest up excessively.</li>\n<li>\nMake a straight line from your head to your heels.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "instructions": "<ol>\n<li>\nUsing a supinated grip, grasp the bar with a shoulder width grip.</li>\n<li>\nTake a deep breath, squeeze your glutes and brace your abs. Depress the shoulder blades and then drive the elbows straight down to the floor while activating the lats.</li>\n<li>\nPull your chin towards one side of the bar until the lats are fully contracted, then slowly shift to the other side of the bar without changing the height of your body. Once the shift is complete, lower yourself back to the start position and repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nTo decrease bicep involvement, use a false (thumbless grip).</li>\n<li>\nTry to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine.</li>\n<li>\nIf the bar is high enough, keep the legs straight and in front of the body.</li>\n<li>\nAvoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs.</li>\n<li>\nThe pullup is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs.</li>\n<li>\nKeep your shoulders down and back, if they round forward at the top then you’ve pulled too far.</li>\n<li>\nA lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone.</li>\n<li>\nLower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder.</li>\n<li>\nIf you can’t complete a single bodyweight pullup, start with slow negatives or flexed arm hangs at the top position.</li>\n<li>\nDitch the straps and kips, neither one is necessary or recommended.</li>\n</ol>\n"

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nIdeally we want to focus on the rear deltoids, not the scapular retractors so movement at the shoulder blade should be limited.

    "tips": "<ol>\n<li>\nThe most important thing you can remember with any soft tissue work: KEEP BREATHING. Don’t hold your breath, you want to release tension, not generate it.</li>\n<li>\nIf you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.\n<ul>\n<li>\nIn addition to some deep breathing, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nFoam/stick rolling may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.\n<ul>\n<li>\nHOWEVER, if you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"

Instead, stay upright and focus on learning to jump without having to rely upon your visual senses.</li>\n<li>\nPicking a jump rope before you begin practicing is the most important step of all. When the rope is looped around the end of your shoe, the bottom of the handles should come up to roughly your arm pits.</li>\n<li>\nThere’s no need for excessively high jumps, only jump high enough so the rope can pass underneath without coming in contact with your feet.

If that's still easy for you, raise one foot off the floor and the opposing hand at the same time.
